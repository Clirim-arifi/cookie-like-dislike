# Cookie Like Dislike Plugin

The Cookie Like Dislike Plugin allows you to add a simple like and dislike functionality to your WordPress website. The plugin uses cookies to remember the user's selection and prevents multiple likes/dislikes.

# Installation

1. Download the plugin from the WordPress plugin repository or upload the plugin folder to your WordPress installation's wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

# Usage

# Shortcode

You can use the [cookie_like_dislike_shortcode] shortcode to display the like and dislike buttons anywhere on your WordPress website. To use the shortcode, simply paste it into any post, page, or widget content.

# After and Before Content

You can also choose to add the like and dislike buttons after or before the content on single posts. To do so, go to the plugin settings and select the desired option. The like and dislike buttons will then be automatically added to the selected location on all single post pages.
